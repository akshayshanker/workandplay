# Play for the Rich and Work for the Poor? 


Replication material to solve for Shanker and Wolfe (2021): "Play for the Rich and Work for the Poor?Optimal Saving and Work Hours in the Heterogeneous Agents Neoclassical Growth Model"

Package solves the incomplete market equilibrium and constrained optima for a Bewley-Aiyagari-Huggett model with labour-leisure choice. 

main.py solves IM and CP using cingle core

main_mpi.py solves IM and CP using cross entropy across multiple nodes. For example, to run using 420 nodes

``` mpiexec -n 420  python3 -m mpi4py main_mpi.py```

Note number of elite draws for cross entropy specified as N_elite paramter in main_mpi.py script.
